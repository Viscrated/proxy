# Simple Discord Webhook Proxy

Seamlessly proxy Discord webhooks, primarily for Roblox. This project allows you to replace the default `discord.com` domain in your webhook URL with a proxy domain. It handles rate limits, complies with Discord's ToS, and is simple to integrate.
## How to Use

1. **Input Discord Webhook URL**: Enter the Discord webhook URL (e.g., `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...`).
2. **Get Proxy URL**: The input URL will be automatically converted to the proxy URL.
3. **Copy Proxy URL**: Click the "Copy" button to copy the proxy URL for use in your app.
